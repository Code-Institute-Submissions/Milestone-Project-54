# Holiday Planner

This is the second milestone project. The Idea of this project was to create a website that would help to plan the holiday. Provide an idea where is the place, see what places the travelers can visit being over there, all of that can be seen on Google map.

## UX

![Responsive Views of Home Page](documents/responsiveness.png)
This website consists of 4 parts. In the 1st part of this website, visitors can see 3 places to visit with high-quality pictures - Jamaica Kingston, Canada Moraine Lake, Norway Sognefjord. By hovering over the section of the place is slightly separated and by clicking on the particular section (or place to visit) the visitor is taken to the map which is the section 2 where they can see that place on the map and by changing options with radio buttons the visitors can see where are the restaurants, hotels, and beaches, the markers give a and idea if the place is open and when the users click on the marker they can see some information picture, place name, rating, the other bits of information is provided according to what the google provides, some places might have a feature how much time left until the place close if closed it might provide when it is opened a link to see the place on google maps. Address and the phone number.3. The section contains a contact form, by filling in the visitor can contact the service provider with any questions. 4. The section is a footer containing links to social platforms.
The design is responsive and can be easily navigated on any size of the screen.
The mock-up looks a bit different than the mockup, it is because I decided not to have a slider but have just 3 sections with pictures, to keep the website simple and display the information clearly, to let the visitors search threw the website quickly.

### Users 

The users group will be any user with an inten to travel to Jamaica Kingston, Canada Moraine Lake, Norway Sognefjord. 

### Design

## Deployment

The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://rimantascode.github.io/Milestone-Project-2/)

The process involved:
- Host a git repository on GitHub. Explained [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/create-a-repo).
- The root folder contains README.md and index.html files
- On GitHub repository settings page move to GitHub Pages section
- Change source to master branch. (Or any desired branch)
- Provided link will be your projects home (index) page.
 
To deploy your own version of the website:
- Have git installed
- Visit the [repository](https://github.com/rimantascode/Milestone-Project-2)
- Click 'Clone or download' and copy the code for http
- Open a terminal in your root directory
- Type 'git clone ' followed by the code taken from github repository
    - ```https://github.com/rimantascode/Milestone-Project-2.git```
- When this completes you have your own version of the website
    - Feel free to make any changes to it
- The website can be run by opening one of the HTML files within a web browser
- Visit the link provided
- Your website with any made changes will appear
- Saved changes to the website will appear here after refreshing the page

The benefits of hosting your website on GitHub pages is that any pushed changes to your project will automatically update the website. Development branches can be created and merged to the master when complete.

It may take a moment for changes to appear on the hosted website.
